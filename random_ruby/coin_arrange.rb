arr=[200,100,50,20,10,5,2,1]
=begin
so, just formalizing the problem statement:

Given coin types = {200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5,2,1};
Target = 400;

You have to find number of ways in which these coins will combine to give target.
For example, if you have coin types of {1, 2, 5} and target 5;
then you can make 5 in following ways: { (1,1,1,1,1), (1,1,1,2), (1, 2, 2), (5)}
So, answer would have been : 4.

In the program, you don'd need to give ways, only number of ways.

Since, it is timed contest; and timing is machine dependent too: so, when you are finished; mail me your code (post it on pastebin; and send me link)

Here is my timings:
(I imagine I have used highly optimized code -- and anyway I am not participating in this one; so don't worry, if you don't get answer near it :P)

real 0m0.041s
user 0m0.036s
sys 0m0.004s

(For easy purposes, we will be comparing real time; so please only I/O operation should be printing of answer. 
Please don't write the answer directly to the file to save on time :P )

Answer expected: 19xxxxx (exact answer hidden :P )
